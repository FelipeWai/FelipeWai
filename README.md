#### Hi! 👋

#### I'm Felipe, a passionate programming student that likes to solve problems and create innovative solutions. 

#### I began my journey with Harvard's CS50x course and have since delved deeper into Python through Mosh Hamedani's 'Complete Python Mastery.'. Currently enrolled in the CS50 Web Programming course, I'm exploring Django, Javascript, and web development. At Universidade Santa Cecília, I'm studying Systems of Information, where I've studied things such as algorithms, databases, and object-oriented programming in C#.
